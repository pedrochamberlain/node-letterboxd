# Letterboxd for Node.js
An asynchronous client library for the Letterboxd REST API.

## Quick Start
You will need valid Letterboxd developer credentials in the form of a set of consumer and access tokens/keys. There's currently no way to get these (unless you're enrolled in the API's beta).

```javascript
const Letterboxd = require('letterboxd');
```

## Impediment
Although the Letterboxd API Documentation is public, there's currently no way to access the API because it's in a private beta. Development will continue upon further notice.

<blockquote>
  <p>The Letterboxd API is in private beta. If youâ€™d like to be considered for early access, please email details of your intended use to api@letterboxd.com. Please include the title of your app or project in the subject line, and note that while we read all applications, we are unable to individually reply, or to guarantee admission to the beta.</p>
  <p>If you require your account data in machine-readable form we have import and export options, and every account has an RSS feed of new diary entries and lists.</p>
